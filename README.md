# Lower-Triangular-Systems-Block-Solver

We consider the following resolution of the linear system LX = B where B is an n × n matrix, L is a lower triangular matrix of size n × n, and X is the unknown, a matrix of size n × n. we can define an interesting block version which is rich in matrix computation.
